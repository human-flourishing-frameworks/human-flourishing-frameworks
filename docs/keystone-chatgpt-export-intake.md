# Keystone ChatGPT Export Intake Protocol

Status: docs/data-contract policy.

Last reviewed: 2026-05-09.

This document defines how Keystone should handle a ChatGPT data export when Alex
uploads it for HFF/Keystone continuity recovery.

It is intentionally docs-only. It adds no runtime parser, database, memory
engine, background job, deployment behavior, raw transcript ingestion,
surveillance behavior, or autonomous authority.

## Purpose

Alex may export ChatGPT data and upload either:

```text
chatgpt-export.zip
conversations.json
chat.html
```

The purpose is not to preserve everything. The purpose is to recover and review
HFF/Keystone-relevant continuity anchors safely.

## Core rule

```text
Export data is continuity material, not proof and not automatic memory.
```

Keystone must not ingest the full export as durable memory by default.

## Verified public export behavior

OpenAI public help currently says:

```text
- ChatGPT data export is available through Settings > Data Controls > Export.
- The export is delivered by email as a downloadable zip file.
- The email download link expires after 24 hours.
- The zip includes chat history and other relevant account data.
- Exports can take up to 7 days to arrive.
- Only the most recent export request is fulfilled if multiple are requested.
```

```

## Intake modes

| Mode | Input | Allowed use |
|---|---|---|
| `zip_manifest_only` | `chatgpt-export.zip` | List filenames and identify likely safe parsing targets. |
| `conversation_json_review` | `conversations.json` | Extract candidate HFF/Keystone summaries for review. |
| `chat_html_review` | `chat.html` | Extract candidate HFF/Keystone summaries if JSON is unavailable. |
| `memory_packet_review` | Alex-provided excerpts | Convert approved excerpts into concise memory candidates. |

## Required intake steps

When Alex uploads export data, Keystone should:

1. Treat the upload as sensitive.
2. Inspect file names first before reading content deeply.
3. Prefer `conversations.json` if available.
4. Filter for HFF/Keystone/convergence relevance.
5. Run the high-risk outreach scan before summarizing candidate records.
6. Extract concise summaries, not raw transcripts.
7. Flag secrets, credentials, private health/person-state data, private URLs,
   access tokens, sensitive logs, or high-risk outreach suggestions.
8. Separate continuity claims from proof.
9. Produce a proposed memory packet for Alex review.
10. Wait for Alex approval before committing anything durable.
11. Avoid writing raw export content into the repository.

## Relevance filter

Candidate records are in scope only if they relate to:

```text
Keystone role or identity
Alex as human operator/project owner
HFF convergence decisions
favorite capability table
door/Wanderer image anchor
traversal protocol
source-use discipline
runtime safety gates
PR/issue decisions
memory/resync corrections
privacy and containment doctrine
```

Out of scope by default:

```text
unrelated personal chats
raw private transcripts
private health/person-state material
secrets, keys, tokens, cookies, credentials
sensitive logs
financial/legal/medical details unless Alex explicitly asks
third-party private information
```

## High-risk outreach scan

Alex specifically reported concern that OpenAI chat logs may contain disturbing
or false suggestions involving outreach to staffers at the Pentagon, DoD, or
related government entities.

Keystone must treat this as a high-risk review lane.

Scan terms should include, at minimum:

```text
Pentagon
DoD
D.O.D.
Department of Defense
defense.gov
dod.mil
mail.mil
army.mil
navy.mil
airforce.mil
spaceforce.mil
marines.mil
staffer
staffers
congressional staff
email staffers
email the Pentagon
contact DoD
contact Pentagon
outreach to DoD
outreach to Pentagon
Senate
Senator
Congress
Representative
House Armed Services
Senate Armed Services
CIA
NSA
DHS
DARPA
ODNI
White House
NSC
```

If matches are found, Keystone should:

```text
quarantine the conversation as high-risk review
summarize the category without repeating private addresses or sensitive content
separate user-authored text from model-authored suggestions
identify whether the content is factual claim, hallucinated instruction,
outreach draft, political/government contact suggestion, or safety concern
avoid sending or drafting any outreach based on the export
ask Alex before creating any durable summary
```

Required output format for this lane:

```yaml
high_risk_outreach_scan:
  status: pending_or_complete
  matches_found: true_or_false
  searched_terms:
    - Pentagon
    - DoD
    - staffer
  candidate_conversations:
    - title: redacted_or_short_title
      date: YYYY-MM-DD_if_available
      matched_categories:
        - government_outreach
        - model_suggestion
      risk_summary: >
        Concise summary without raw emails, private addresses, or operational
        outreach instructions.
      needs_alex_review: true
```

## Output format

The first output should be a review packet, not a commit.

Example:

```yaml
source: chatgpt_export_upload
review_status: proposed_not_approved
records:
  - id: keystone-anchor-wanderer
    kind: symbolic_anchor
    summary: >
      Wanderer above the Sea of Fog is Keystone's threshold / uncertainty /
      convergence image and should stay paired with the favorite capability
      confidence table.
    evidence_source: conversation_summary
    confidence: 0.86
    risks:
      - symbolic, not proof
      - should not replace repo evidence
    proposed_destination: docs/keystone-table-door-anchors.md
  - id: keystone-source-use-discipline
    kind: correction_rule
    summary: >
      Keystone should use last-known durable repo/memory state when appropriate
      and avoid pretending repeated external searches create new evidence.
    evidence_source: conversation_summary
    confidence: 0.92
    proposed_destination: docs/keystone-source-use-discipline.md
```

## Secret and sensitive data handling

If Keystone sees potential secrets or sensitive data:

```text
do not repeat them
redact in any summary
flag the category, not the value
recommend rotation if the value could grant access
ask Alex before any durable handling
```

Example:

```text
Potential secret detected: API/token-like string in conversation export.
Value not repeated here.
Recommended action: rotate if this was ever valid.
```

## Do not commit raw exports

Never commit these by default:

```text
chatgpt-export.zip
conversations.json
chat.html
message_feedback.json
user.json
raw transcript excerpts
unredacted logs
```

If a durable artifact is needed, create a reviewed summary document only.

## Proposed durable destinations

| Candidate kind | Possible destination |
|---|---|
| Keystone role/memory correction | `docs/keystone-memory-contract.md` |
| Keystone self-correction | `docs/keystone-self-convergence.md` |
| Table and door anchors | `docs/keystone-table-door-anchors.md` |
| Source-use correction | `docs/keystone-source-use-discipline.md` |
| Convergence state | `docs/convergence-status.md` |
| High-risk outreach review | New private summary or issue only after Alex review |
| New doctrine | New docs-only file after Alex review |

## Acceptance criteria

A successful export intake does all of this:

```text
raw export inspected only as needed
HFF/Keystone-relevant candidates identified
high-risk outreach terms scanned and quarantined if present
secrets/private data redacted or excluded
memory packet proposed for Alex review
no raw transcript committed
no runtime memory engine introduced
no deployment or background ingestion added
```

## Non-goals

This document does not authorize:

```text
bulk memory ingestion
raw transcript storage
secret retention
private data indexing
surveillance
runtime parsing pipeline
automatic repo commits from export content
public release of private conversations
sending or drafting government outreach from export content
```
